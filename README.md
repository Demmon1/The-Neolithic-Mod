# The Neolithic Mod - Demmon1's Tweaks

Forked from the original Neolithic Mod for greater control over my experience with it while maintaining a convenient update pipeline.

Complete list of tweaks:

-Removed "Giant Arundo Reeds" from the world generation.

-Removed crafting recipe for "burden baskets".

-Primitive Fence Midsection recipe now uses "Very Thin" branches.

-Increase inventory size of bamboo chests to 24 (was 16).

-Restore vanilla ore deposit distribution.

-Restore vanilla stone path shape

-Reduce firewood crafting recipes to "Vanilla-like" scale
